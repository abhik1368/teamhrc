General ideas:
	1) # of contacts with Hillary (ex. Sidney Blumenthal)
	2) Sentiment analysis
		a) Over time
		b) Categorized by person, location, 
		c) Vocabulary profile / word count by part of speech - can syntax impart intention?
	3) Normalizing sentiment - baseline attitude of Hillary? Wingman?
